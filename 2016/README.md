This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from MongoDB customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum.

>Through acquisition of several competitors, my company has numerous redundant order 
>entry, processing and fulfillment systems. When a customer contacts us via phone or 
>via the Website, any order the customer may have placed could reside in any of these 
>systems, causing confusion, delay and error. We are looking at a master-data-management 
>solution, with a 24 month design and delivery cycle that we find prohibitive. mongoDB 
>lists this type of problem as single-view, and as one of the problems that your 
>database server and its ecosystem help address. What can you tell me ?
>
>In this article we deliver CDC from MySQL and Redis into mongoDB with a Web UI.

>After our initial (and hugely successful) project writing a mobile application that 
>uses MongoDB, I have been tasked with determining our run time environment for the

>In this article we overview mongoDB Ops Mgr, Cloud Mgr, and Atlas. We also install,

>My team and I have been tasked with learning MongoDB, writing queries and getting 
>a new project out of the door in 3 weeks. I know how to write most queries in SQL,
