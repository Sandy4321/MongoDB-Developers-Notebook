>Customer:
>I really enjoyed the December/2016 edition of this document where you detailed the single 
>view use case, however; you left off Kafka as a topic, and while you ingested data from 
>multiple sources, you failed to detail how to get data out of mongoDB. What can you tell 
>me ?

>Daniel:
>In this article we continue our work from the December/2016 document, and add Kafka as a
>data source and target. And we read from the mongoDB oplog to do that push into Kafka. The
>July/2016 edition of this document detailed the mongoDB Connector, which does this work 
>and more, but we wanted to demonstrate writing this code from scratch.
